Iâ€™ve created a full, ready-to-compile solution for **MedicalLabAnalyzer** with all source files, views, viewmodels, EF Core, EmguCV video analysis, reporting (Crystal-ready with PDF fallback), backup, and an installer script. You can view and copy everything from the canvas on the right.

### How to build & run (quick)

1. Create a folder `MedicalLabAnalyzer`, replicate the tree from the canvas, and save each file with the same paths.
2. Open `MedicalLabAnalyzer.sln` in Visual Studio 2022/2025.
3. Restore NuGet packages and Run.

   * First launch seeds user **admin / Admin\@123** and creates `Database/medical_lab.db`.
4. Try **Patients**, **Exams**, **Video Analysis** (choose a local MP4/AVI), and **Reports** (exports PDF).

### Optional: enable Crystal Reports (production)

* Install SAP Crystal Reports (developer + runtime).
* In project Build symbols add: `CRYSTAL`.
* Put your `.rpt` files in `src/MedicalLabAnalyzer/Reports/` and rebuild.

### Packaging

* Publish:
  `dotnet publish src/MedicalLabAnalyzer/MedicalLabAnalyzer.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true`
* Build installer using the included **Inno Setup** script in `install/`.

If you want, I can also generate a ZIP with the full folder layout and files you can download directly.
