# Build Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified

The build failures in both Debug and Release configurations were caused by several missing components:

### 1. Missing Test Project
- **Issue**: The solution file referenced `tests\MedicalLabAnalyzer.Tests\MedicalLabAnalyzer.Tests.csproj` but the directory and project file didn't exist
- **Fix**: Created the missing test project structure:
  - Created `/tests/MedicalLabAnalyzer.Tests/` directory
  - Created `MedicalLabAnalyzer.Tests.csproj` with proper xUnit test project configuration
  - Moved existing test files from `src/MedicalLabAnalyzer/Tests/` to the proper test project location
  - Added a basic xUnit test to make the project buildable

### 2. Missing Application Icon
- **Issue**: Project referenced `Resources\app.ico` which didn't exist
- **Fix**: Commented out the ApplicationIcon reference in the project file to prevent build errors

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow Issues
- **Issue**: No proper CI/CD workflow existed, and the error mentioned Windows Server migration
- **Fix**: Created `.github/workflows/build.yml` with:
  - Explicit use of `windows-2022` runner to avoid migration notices
  - Proper .NET 8.0 setup
  - Build matrix for both Debug and Release configurations
  - Proper test execution
  - Artifact upload for Release builds

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Created**: `/tests/MedicalLabAnalyzer.Tests/MedicalLabAnalyzer.Tests.csproj`
2. **Created**: `/tests/MedicalLabAnalyzer.Tests/UnitTest1.cs`
3. **Created**: `/.github/workflows/build.yml`
4. **Modified**: `/src/MedicalLabAnalyzer/MedicalLabAnalyzer.csproj` (commented out ApplicationIcon)
5. **Moved**: Test files from `src/MedicalLabAnalyzer/Tests/` to `tests/MedicalLabAnalyzer.Tests/`

## Expected Results

- Both Debug and Release builds should now complete successfully
- Tests should run (though the existing test files are static utility classes, not xUnit tests)
- No more Windows Server migration notices
- Proper CI/CD workflow for future development

## Next Steps

1. Convert the static test classes to proper xUnit test methods if needed
2. Add a proper application icon if desired
3. Verify all necessary source files exist and compile correctly
